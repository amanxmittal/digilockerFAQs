Question: Give us details about the DigiLocker integration with the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH). What are the benefits of this integration for citizens?
Answer: DigiLocker is recognized by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways via notification (RT-11036/64/2017-MVL dated 08/08/2018) as a digital platform for making available digital driving licenses and vehicle registration certificates to Indian citizens. DigiLocker is now directly integrated with the National Register, which is the national database of driving license and vehicle registration data across the country. Henceforth, DigiLocker users will be able to access their digital Registration Certificate and Driving License both on desktop computers and on mobile devices.
Benefits of this integration:
Paperless Services: Digital driving license and vehicle registration certificate will minimize the use of physical documents.
Authentic Records: Citizens can share the authentic digital certificates directly from the data source with other departments as identity and address proof resulting in a reduction of administrative overhead.
Spot Verification: The digital RC and DL in a DigiLocker account can be spot-verified for authenticity either by validating the Digital Signature of MoRTH on the PDF copy of the document or by scanning the QR code on digital documents by using the QR scan facility on the DigiLocker mobile app.
No need to carry the original physical form of documents while driving a vehicle: The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has issued a D.O to all state transport departments about the acceptance of Driving Licenses and Vehicle Registration Certificates when presented through the issued section of DigiLocker are deemed to be legally recognized at par with the original documents as per the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000.

Question: Please explain the process of getting the digital DL & RC in DigiLocker.
Answer: For getting the digital Driving License and Vehicle Registration Certificate, users should ensure their Aadhaar number is linked with their DigiLocker account. Once it is done, the User can go to the Quick Link section on the dashboard and click on “Get your Digital Driving license” and “Get your Digital Vehicle RC”. This will allow fetching the document from the MoRTH database. Once the document is fetched, a URI is created and saved automatically in their ‘Issued section of DigiLocker’ for later reuse. Citizens can get their Digital Driving License and Vehicle Registration Certificate on both desktop and mobile devices.

Question: Does my name matter while fetching my Digital Driving License and Vehicle Registration Certificate through DigiLocker? I can see a non-editable field for the Aadhaar name while filling out the requisite details.
Answer: While fetching the MoRTH digital records in DigiLocker, your name in your Aadhaar card should match your name in the Vehicle Registration Certificate & Driving License database of the National Register. This ensures that only the rightful owner of the documents is able to fetch the digital Driving License and Vehicle Registration Certificate.

Question: I followed the instructions but could not get my digital Driving License and Vehicle Registration Certificate via DigiLocker. It says 'No record available in issuer database for given document no. Please check your document number and try again.' Why am I not able to get my documents through DigiLocker?
Answer: DigiLocker has integrated with the National Register, which is a central database maintained by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. If your Driving License and Vehicle Registration Certificate record does not exist in the National Register, DigiLocker will not be able to get it for you.

Question: I am getting an error message 'The details provided did not match the issuer data. Please try again with some changes.' What does this mean and what can I do to get my data?
Answer: This message can come if some of the details filled by you are incorrect. Please re-enter the correct information and try again.

Question: I tried linking my Aadhaar with DigiLocker, but it gives an error 'This Aadhaar is already registered'. How can this be possible?
Answer: This error can only be possible if your Aadhaar is already linked with a DigiLocker account and now you have created another DigiLocker account and are trying to link Aadhaar with that account. We suggest you try to retrieve your credentials using Forgot Username/Password (using Aadhaar) for the first account and continue using it.

Question: My name and DoB in Aadhaar is the same as in DL and RC. I am still not able to fetch my DL/RC in my DigiLocker Account.

Question: I am a CBSE student. How can I get my digital mark sheet on DigiLocker?
Answer: How to Access Your CBSE Certificates: DigiLocker has created DigiLocker accounts for students using the mobile numbers shared by CBSE.
Students have received an SMS on their mobile number registered with CBSE.
Students should use this mobile number to log in to their accounts.
Enter the OTP received on the registered Mobile Number.
Enter the last 6 digits of your Roll number as the security PIN and Login.
After successful Login, the student should go to the 'Issued Document' section of DigiLocker and you will see all your class X or XII certificates here.
